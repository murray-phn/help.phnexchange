# PHN Exchange Overview

PHN Exchange is an innovative population health knowledge management system that’s designed to support, influence and improve health outcomes.  
 
Gathering data from multiple sources, PHN Exchange presents a customisable view for PHN staff, health planners, and health providers to use in a multitude of ways to better inform decision making. 
 
As a living needs assessment tool, PHN Exchange has been specifically designed to localise data and information and deepen understandings about communities in a given region. 
 
In fact, the benefits are as multi-layered as the mapping capabilities. Processes are standardised; time is saved; business efficiencies are gained; risks are reduced; transparency is fostered. 

Most importantly, common dialogue is initiated for shared understandings and stronger relationships between agencies. 
 
Originally conceived and developed by Murray PHN for its own use, the inherent potential in the design and functionality of the platform was quickly identified and shared with other early adopting PHNs. Evolving in scale and depth to soon include the mapping of these other PHN areas, PHN Exchange is now poised with the capacity and scalability to become the primary population health service planning platform for the sector across Australia.

# Introduction to this documentation

This guide is primarily for use by PHN staff working with General Practice.
PHNs' strategic health priorities reflect the issues and conditions that have the greatest impact on the lives of people living in their communities. They are determined by population health data and aligned to Australian Government health program areas. More importantly, they are areas in which PHNs are committed to achieving targeted health improvements across their regions.

Staff supporting and / or interacting with General Practice are a key enabler for PHNs to improve population health outcomes. Working in a relationship of trust, they form a vital link into the General Practice sector supporting improved data quality and better outcomes for patients / clients of the practice, as well as long term business sustainability of practices..
