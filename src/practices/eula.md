# Document acceptance system (EULA capture)

The PHN Exchange has an incorporated document acceptance system. It allows each PHN to manage their individual documents (EULA T&A Consent). Each PHN using the PHN Exchange can manage presentation of thier documentation to a practice via the PHN Exchange. 
If a PHN updates its data sharing conditions, it is able , through this system, to present the document to the practice the next time the practice logs into the PHN Exchange. Acceptance of the document by the practice is logged in the PHN Exchange.
