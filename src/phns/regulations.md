# Regulations

All data is stored and controlled according to key legislation. 

The PHNs have been identified as local custodians of the data a General Practice has shared. This means that the PHN and its staff have obligations in the collection, storage and use of the data. 

As the data from General Practice is de-identified, each PHN’s custodial obligations are governed by Australian Privacy Principles. [CLICK HERE](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/) to review relevant and up to date information. 

The States and Territories also have individual Health Records legislation. Although these usually apply to the custodial obligations of identified data, it is good to understand the legislation. [CLICK HERE](https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/about/legislation/health-records-act) for full up to date information for Victoria, as an example.
