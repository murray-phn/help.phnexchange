# **Practices**

A list of all practices within the PHN.

To allow a user access to view practice data they must be added as a **Practice Member**.

## **Practice Members**

**Practice Members** are PHN Exchange **Members** that have permission to General Practice features and data through a dashboard named the **GP Hub**.

**PHN Admins** can gives practice staff access to the **GP Hub** through either an automatic or manual process.

- Click Admin on the left menu and navigate to your PHN.

- Scroll to the bottom of the practice page and find the Practice Member section.
- Click "Create" and a popup will appear, supply the email address of a registered account on the PHN Exchange and toggle the flag "Is Practice Manager" to YES and click the CREATE button.

## Using PATCAT to automatically setup **Practice Members**

If the email address in PATCAT against a practice is the same email address that they have registered with, they are automatically assigned as a practice member.

To confirm if a practice has the correct email address assigned in PATCAT:

- Login to your PHN PATCAT portal, for Murray PHN it isÂ <a href="https://patcat.murrayphn.org.au/" target="_blank">https://patcat.murrayphn.org.au/</a> (2min 29 secs)
- In the top right of the page after login click `Practices`.
- Select a practice and confirm the associated email address is correct.
- After updating the email address in PATCAT PHN Exchange should take one minute to reflect the new changes.
- After PHN Exchange has detected the email change, the practice member using the email address needs to sign out and sign in again to now see the **GP Hub** button.
