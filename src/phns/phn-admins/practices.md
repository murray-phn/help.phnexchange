To confirm if a practice has the correct email address assigned in PATCAT:

- Login to your PHN PATCAT portal, for Murray PHN it isÂ <a href="https://patcat.murrayphn.org.au/" target="_blank">https://patcat.murrayphn.org.au/</a> (2min 29 secs)
- In the top right of the page after login click `Practices`.
- Select a practice and confirm the associated email address is correct.
- After updating the email address in PATCAT PHN Exchange should take one minute to reflect the new changes.
- After PHN Exchange has detected the email change, the practice member using the email address needs to sign out and sign in again to now see the **GP Hub** button.
