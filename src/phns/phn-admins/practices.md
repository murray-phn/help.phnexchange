In this area there are four functionalities associated to the practices:

- Practices: list of all practices within the PHN;
- Practice Resources: the resources created for practices;
- Practice Groups: manage groups of practices;
- Practice Datasources: 

## **Practice Datasources**

This is where you enter your PATCAT database details with a read only database user to connect the PHN Exchange to your PATCAT database.

Please note that in most cases the **driver** text field in most cases will be: `sqlsrv`

## **Practice Resources**

This is where you can see and create new resources and assign them to practices. The practice members will be able to view it on their **GP HUB** area. The resources are hyperlinks that will lead the members of that practice to specific pages; 

**NOTE:** you need to create a resource first and mark as "Is Exclusive" before assign it to practices. If is not exclusive, this will be available to all the practices in your PHN.

## **Practice Groups**

This is where you can aggroup your PHN practices in any way you like. This will allow you and other PHN Admins to compare these practices against each other on the **PHN at a Glance** page, section <a href="../../phn-admins/phn-at-a-glance/#practices-overview">Practices Overview</a>.
