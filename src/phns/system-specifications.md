## Support and resources

PHN Exchange staff will assist you to configure and populate data into PHN Exchange, support and resources included in the licensing agreement include:

- Direct telephone support will be provided to key administrators, PHN developers and systems support staff.
- Short `how to` videos for your administrative staff to configure and manage data inputs into PHN Exchange.

## Each PHN governs it's own data and information

For the components your PHN has licensed, your nominated staff are provided with administration access to your PHN.

This gives you access to several controls:

- Manage your **Practice Datasource** which controls the connection to your General practice extract Database.
- Manage your **Licences** (EULAs, Data sharing, Consent) to relevant external parties.
- Input and manage your own specific data where required.

## Automated features

Once your administrator has connected the PHN Exchange to your general practice extract data using the **Practice Datasource**, the PHN Exchange has the capacity for several automated features.

These include:

- Creating individual areas for practices within the PHN Exchange known as the **GP Hub**. 
- Populating information about practices in the **Practice Profile**.
- Generation of individual practice reports known as the **GP Data Report**.
- Uses the email for registering practices as the PATCAT system.
- Only allows a practice to view their own data using secured login and user permissioning.
- Automatically aggregates and averages all practices data using the PHN Exchange to provide benchmarking.
- Automatic PIP QI dashboarding and reporting for PHN administrators.

The ABS Atlas is a mapping system linked live to the Australian Bureau of Statistics data sets.

- The ABS atlas automatically displays the latest information available.
- Information is available by region, PHN, LGA SA1/2/3 as ABS statistical areas.

PHN Exchange developer staff will assist in automating as many data feeds as possible. 

However in many cases, the external custodians of these data sets do not provide interfaces allowing automation, also known as an API. 

Currently in Victoria it is possible to automatically update priority area and hotspotting information using the Victorian Health Information Surveillance System (VHISS).
