As a living needs assessment tool, PHN Exchange has been specifically designed to localise data and information and deepen understandings about communities in a given region. In fact, the benefits are as multi-layered as the mapping capabilities. Processes are standardised; time is saved; business efficiencies are gained; risks are reduced; transparency is fostered. Most importantly, common dialogue is initiated for shared understandings and stronger relationships between agencies.

This means knowing how they log on and access their report. What are the stages they need to have completed to do this? Who will you call if the report cannot be accessed at the practice location? Pre-validation should also be completed prior to attendance at the practice. A comparison of data between the GP Data Report and the PATCAT web platform should be completed in order that you have confidence that the data is validated. Validation and analysis also supports your decision of which indicators within the report should be chosen to focus on with the practice. Know your MBS items and understand which of the report\u2019s indicators can be worked on by the Practice Manager and / or Nurse. Initial engagement should not place additional burdens on the General Practitioner. You can also calculate the business benefit of improving the data quality of certain reports. Check that the practice has access to the report The practice can access the report by registering with their Microsoft account details. The system will match the PenCS login with their credentials. Know your support Determine what you will do at the practice if there are technical difficulties. Access the GP data report for your practice at your office prior to attending at the practice Register and use login credentials to access the report via the PHN Exchange. Access the PATCAT web portal at your office prior to attending at the practice Register and use login credentials to access the PATCAT report via your administrator. Access the CAT4 demonstration software (some PHNs have this available) at your office prior to attending at the practice Know how to use the CAT4 software. Compare and validate GP Data report and the PATCAT report at your office prior to attending at the practice Compare the number of active patients shown in the GP Data Report to the PATCAT information. Compare the number of active patients categorised as having: Diabetes CHD COAD Mental health conditions Access the GP data report for your practice Review the report for this practice at your office prior to attending at the practice. Know how to print the report using the browser functions. Access the GP data report for your practice. Review the report for this practice at your office prior to attending at the practice Identify parts of the report which can be addressed by the Practice Nurse / Manager. Review the report for this practice at your office prior to attending at the practice Identify parts of the report which can be addressed by the Practice Nurse / Manager which can be proposed as areas of improvement. Review the report for this practice at your office prior to attending at the practice Use the resources section to find the GP MBS funding (Doctor MBS quick guide). Calculate the revenue possible from the GP data report. Engaging with the practice # Practice engagement should be contextualised. The advice from senior staff outweighs any specific guidance from this document. Please use the points in this section as a guide. Engagement should result in the practice having confidence in your support, confidence in understanding the data and also an agreed path forward (including the way in which future communication will be undertaken). Making the appointment Use this telephone conversation to identify the correct person you should be engaged with at the practice. Use this telephone conversation to ask them to run a CAT4 report to tell you how many active patients they have. The meeting Introduce yourself, make sure the practice has your contact details. Demonstrate the PHN Exchange Show the publicly available data. Show the ABS mapping system. Show the Learning Management System \u2013 GP practices may want to use the LMS for their staff induction or some CPD. Demonstrating the GP Data Report Assist them to access their GP Data Report. Show them the features including the 1 minute videos for each section. Show the figures as they align with their CAT4 report. This will provide them with confidence in the report. Focus on the areas for data quality improvement Always state that data quality improvement will primarily lead to better outcomes for patients. With the examples you have developed, show them the additional revenue possible. Recording the report Print out for the practice so they can refer to it in three months\u2019 time when the report is automatically updated. Arrange review visits By telephone, video conferencing or in person. Initial meeting should be held in person with follow up using video conferencing. Ongoing data quality improvement exercises Use the GP Data Report to track any changes due to actions decided.","title":"Engagement with Practices"},{"location":"practices/engagement/#data-sharing-agreements","text":"Primary Health Networks (PHNs) work directly with general practices to develop and implement quality improvement initiatives, which is key in improving patient health outcomes.

When practices login to their GP Data Report, they will be requested to confirm that details held in the PHN Exchange about their practice are correct. The following profile field will appear for each practice as they log into their GP Data Report. This information should be regarded as the one source of truth, and it is this information that should be transcribed into your PHN\u2019s client relationship management system. A customised verserion of Dynamics 365 customer relationship management systems is recommended to be used in conjunction with the PHN Exchange. GP Data report # The capability of automated reporting at an incidence level is unique to the GP Data Report and can interface with any of the multiple software programs currently used in the primary care sector. The GP Data Report is tailored for each practice and displays practice trends and regional and catchment-wide comparisons, so GPs can make informed decisions about their patients, workforce and practice. The graphical data monitors areas such as demographics, disease prevalence, immunisation status, cancer screening rates and activities of patients with chronic disease. This allows practices to identify gaps, improve detection rates, use early interventions and achieve better outcomes. Reports also include patient indicators across focus areas including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders and diabetes. The dashboard reports display constant 15-month trends and are updated monthly. This automated process saves a practice significant time in producing reports and can also be used as evidence of data monitoring and quality improvement activities for accreditation. Benchmarking # A unique feature of the GP Data Report is its ability to benchmark shared data. Each practice views their own data and averages calculated from all data sharing practices. This enables the practice to assess their performance against their peers. Of course, all practice specific data is only viewable by the practice sharing its data. Please see below for an explanation of benchmarking Example 1 # The chart below displays one of the PIP QI measures for a practice. In this case there is a view of the last 15 months and this chart shows that as of October 2019, the practice has recorded an alcohol consumption status for 66% of its patients. This is compared to the benchmark average of all data sharing practices of 42% Example 2 # In this example, as of October 2019, the practice has 516 active patients diagnosed with a mental health condition or prescribed one or more certain medications. We can also see that only 142 patients have a Mental Health Treatment Plan recorded and only 21 have Mental Health Treatment Plan reviews Validating # GP Engagement Validating the GP data report (2 min 11 secs) CLICK HERE .

It shows the individual connection details between the PHN Exchange and your PHN's GP Data source (The database of extracted and de-identified GP Data, held by and under the custodianship of your PHN). Only designated people within the PHN should modify or edit this section. Note that the PHN Exchange does not use individual lines of data but rather aggregates numbers within the PHN's database and sends the aggregates back to the PHN Exchange for visualisations to the GP Practice. The PHN Exchange sends a database query to the PHN\u2019s database and calculates the number of patients for a practice on the PHNs data base. This number is sent back to the PHN Exchange.

Generally, most data extraction software available on the market today extracts more data sets than are required for a practice to receive the Medicare payment. PHNs usually wish to enter into data sharing arrangements with practices to extract as much data as possible. However, some Practices prefer to only share the PIP QI data set.

De-identification # The extent of de-identification of data and the point at which this occurs in the data reporting process; The automatic extraction software (for example PenCS or Outcome Health) will not extract any data set from a practice where there are fewer than 5 records for any statistical area. For the PenCS PIP QI software, all data is extracted to the PHN database and then all except the PIP QI measures are deleted by the software. Practices who do not agree with this process have a portal to which they can manually upload data to the PHN. For Polar I believe only the PIP QI measures are extracted and sent to the Polar data Warehouse in Melbourne ( data remains under the custodianship of the PHN). Reports to the Department from any PHN do not involve any patient data, de-identified or otherwise. Relationships # The two predominant extraction tools are Outcome Health\u2019s POLAR and PenCS\u2019 SHEDULER AND PATCAT / PAT BI. The relationship between the PHN and the Practice is the key to an agreed use of these products. The staff member (Business Partner) is the key contact with the Practice. After agreement between the Practice and the PHN, the vendor is requested to install the appropriate software at the Practice. The automatic upload of data, including its success rate, is monitored by the Business Partner and remedial actions are coordinated by the Business Partner when issues occur. Manual Submission # Please contact the PHN Exchange Helpdesk for the option of direct submission of the PIP QI dataset by General Practices to PHNs.","title":"PIP QI"},{"location":"practices/pipqi/#pip-qi","text":"On 1 August 2019, the Department launched the Practice Incentive Payment Quality Improvement Medical Benefits Scheme (MBS) Incentive payment for General Rractices who actively share a defined data set with their PHN and participate in data quality improvement activities.

For the PenCS PIP QI software, all data is extracted to the PHN database and then all except the PIP QI measures are deleted by the software. Practices who do not agree with this process have a portal to which they can manually upload data to the PHN. For Polar I believe only the PIP QI measures are extracted and sent to the Polar data Warehouse in Melbourne ( data remains under the custodianship of the PHN). Reports to the Department from any PHN do not involve any patient data, de-identified or otherwise.","title":"De-identification"},{"location":"practices/pipqi/#relationships","text":"The two predominant extraction tools are Outcome Health\u2019s POLAR and PenCS\u2019 SHEDULER AND PATCAT / PAT BI. The relationship between the PHN and the Practice is the key to an agreed use of these products. The staff member (Business Partner) is the key contact with the Practice. After agreement between the Practice and the PHN, the vendor is requested to install the appropriate software at the Practice. The automatic upload of data, including its success rate, is monitored by the Business Partner and remedial actions are coordinated by the Business Partner when issues occur.","title":"Relationships"},{"location":"practices/pipqi/#manual-submission","text":"Please contact the PHN Exchange Helpdesk for the option of direct submission of the PIP QI dataset by General Practices to PHNs.","title":"Manual Submission"},{"location":"user-guides/members/","text":"Registering on the PHN Exchange # Go to PHN Exchange .
