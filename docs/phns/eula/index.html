<p>The PHN Exchange has an incorporated document acceptance system. It allows each PHN to manage their individual documents (EULA T&amp;A Consent). Each PHN using the PHN Exchange can manage presentation of their documentation to a practice via the PHN Exchange. 
If a PHN updates its data sharing conditions, it is able to present the revised document to the practice the next time the practice logs into the PHN Exchange. Acceptance of the document by the practice is logged in the PHN Exchange.</p>
<h1 id="phn-exchange-terms-and-conditions">PHN Exchange terms and conditions<a class="headerlink" href="#phn-exchange-terms-and-conditions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Please note that users of the PHN Exchange are also requested to accept terms and conditions of use of the PHN Exchange on the first three logins by the user.</p>
<p>Below are step by step instructions for practices to access their terms and conditions and EULA agreements. </p>
